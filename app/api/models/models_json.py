"""
This model is for defining standard json api calls.
Bubble.io does not by default send apis in typical 
JSON formatting. This module is intended to make sure
that the APIs function correctly using standard
JSON. 

The models_bubble.py module is then intended
to translate the bubble API calls into useable
data based on the functionality developed in this
module.
